# start a new git repository
Your first instinct, when you start to do something new, should be git init. You’re starting to write a new paper, you’re writing a bit of code to do a computer simulation, you’re mucking around with some new data … anything: think git init.

# A new repo from scratch
Say you’ve just got some data from a collaborator and are about to start exploring it.

* Create a directory to contain the project.
* Go into the new directory.
* Type git init.
* Write some code.
* Type git add to add the files (see the typical use page).
* Type git commit.

The first file to create (and add and commit) is probably a ReadMe file, either as plain text or with Markdown, describing the project.

Markdown allows you to add a bit of text markup, like hyperlinks, bold/italics, or to indicate code with a monospace font. Markdown is easily converted to html for viewing in a web browser, and GitHub will do this for you automatically.
